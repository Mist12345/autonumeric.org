The [autonumeric.org](https://autonumeric.org) website serves the official documentation for the [AutoNumeric.js](https://github.com/autoNumeric/autoNumeric/) library.

It's built with the awesome [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) framework, as well as the great [Quasar framework](http://quasar-framework.org/).

Pull requests are welcome!

## On Translations

At one point we'll need to translate this documentation.<br>
We'll keep you posted here how you could help!

We got the French and English covered, and ideally we will need translators for Italian, Spanish, German, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, Korean, etc.

### Want to help with the translation?

If you feel okay with translating sorta alone, you can fork the repo, create a `work-in-progress` issue to inform others that you're doing the translation, and go for it.

Thank you in advance ;)
